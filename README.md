# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is fun, but why not make it better?

Here's the board:

To win, simply win more mini boards than your opponent, the computer.

Winning by three mini boards in a row like normal is hard because of the high occurence of ties, so a system of quantity is used to determine the winner.

There is a new twist: On your (and the computer's) turn, you can play on any mini board on the big board. This adds a new level of strategy.

Your opponent trying to bait you into a trap on one mini board? Completely ignore them and win a different mini board. This is just one example.

I've included the application and code (in C++) for you to investigate.

Note: The code isn't optimised or professional as this was my first experience with C++.

ENJOY!!!!
